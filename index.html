      <h2>
        Personal Information
      </h2>

      <p>
        Hey! I’m Lachie, a first-year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying a bachelor’s degree in information technology. While I am technically a first year, I had completed the first semester of a Computer Science degree at RMIT in 2021, however due to the move to online classes in second semester and personally not enjoying the course at that point I decided to take the second semester off and start fresh in IT in 2022.
      </p>

      <p >
        I like to think of myself as quite a unique individual, however a fair amount of the hobbies that I have could be considered quite normal. In my free time I am an avid gamer, as well as a fan of both Anime and Manga. As far as gaming goes, I love playing first-person shooters primarily having played Overwatch for the better part of 5 years, before moving to playing Valorant following building a gaming PC in the middle of 2021 (don’t ask my bank account how it’s doing, it still hasn’t recovered). With anime and manga, the primary genre I am a fan is shōnen. My top three anime/manga that I’ve seen or read would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(franchise)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akira</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Stone</a>. I have also recently started reading again and am currently progressing through the works of the Japanese surrealist author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haruki Murakami</a>, with his novel ‘Norwegian Wood’ having quickly become my favourite book.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Interest in IT
      </h2>

      <p>
        My initial interest in IT started when I was around 10 and I was playing Minecraft. My dad had seen me using different commands in one of my Minecraft worlds I had at the time and said that it reminded him of programming which piqued my interest in learning how to code to one day be a games developer. This hope to one day become a games developer further blossomed when I fell quite ill across late 2013 until early 2015 when I was dealing with an undiagnosed auto-immune disease called Achalasia, which made it quite difficult to eat as it effected the muscles in my throat and oesophageal sphincter. Due to this I had to give up the many sports I played and with my newfound time I developed a deeper love of gaming, further fuelling my dream of being a games developer. However, as I looked further into the games industry, I discovered just how hard it would be to break into the industry and thus decided to take a slight shift and look more towards doing something else in the IT industry which is where I am at now.
      </p>

      <p>
        When looking into getting into IT with tertiary education, the three universities I was primarily looking at were RMIT, Swinburne, and Monash. The main reason I was looking at these three unis was because of the praise and general high standards that these three universities had showcased to me during open days as well as during online research. However, when it came to prioritising one university over another, I chose to have Monash and RMIT stand over Swinburne due to the former two having greater global recognition, which I consider quite important with having a globe spanning career. Further deciding between Monash and RMIT was due to personal reasons rather than academic. With Monash having its main campus located in Clayton it would be quite inconvenient to get to when compared to RMIT. Furthermore, with RMIT located in the city it creates an atmosphere of professionalism I quite like, with the commute into the city almost emulating a commute into a working job. Additionally, the added amenities in the city, whether that be bars, shops, restaurants, or other entertainment venues are all an added bonus when studying at RMIT.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my studies at RMIT, I would love (and expect) to learn a deep understanding of programming and the creation process of computer systems. While I’m not fussed about what languages of code I learn while undertaking my degree, I’m personally more interested in learning the processes of learning new languages quickly and efficiently which I personally think will be an invaluable skill when moving into the professional IT landscape. Furthermore, I think an important skill to learn and refine is being able to communicate effectively between both team members undertaking a project and those who the project will be made for.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Ideal Job
      </h2>

      <p>
        For my ideal job in IT, two main things that I would look for would be flexibility with working environments/hours, as well as the possibility for career growth either within the company or externally with the skills I will be able to learn in my position. I think something that would suit me for a job would be something in which I would be communicating between different groups, as I consider my communication skills to be one of my best assets coming to work in the IT field. However, I would not want to be stuck exclusively to managing teams but would involve me with the technical aspects of the work being conducted.  
      </p>

      <p>
        One job I found that I believe embodies what I view as an ideal job is this listing for a <a href="https://www.blackroc.co/job/lead-developer-2"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lead developer</a> through the company Blackroc, a technology search and recruitment firm . Within this role the two of the three main things that I had listed as what I would look for in an ideal job can be met. These being the ability to work remote, as the job listing has flexible working from home options, although still having 1-2 days working in office. This would allow me to live elsewhere to Brisbane, while staying in the city for the needed time for the days in which I am working in the office. Furthermore, it would allow me to have a balance between working in the development side of the technology whilst also using my communication skills to work with company leads and stockholders to give updated and relevant information on the progression of our projects and future of our development.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the job being for a lead developer, someone having many years’ worth of experience working within the tech industry, I would be entirely out of my league if I were to attempt to do this job with my current skillset. Furthermore, the listing requires specifically .NET core experience, something that I personally have no experience with at all and prior to finding the listing had only ever briefly having heard of. The job also emphasises experience with developing front-end designs for modern websites and UI solutions, as well as having experience working and building teams for the development. While I currently do not have much experience with these aspects of the job, the completion of my course would act as a solid steppingstone in developing these necessary skills. Throughout the completion of my course, working in teams will be a constant and unavoidable task I will have to undertake, allowing me to gain knowledge and skills to work with a variety of people ranging from good friends to people I may clash with in the vision of the projects we work on. Additionally, selecting electives that specifically focus on front end user design, including web design, will further improve my ability to create well designed websites and UI’s.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Professional Profile
      </h2>

      <p>
        When undertaking the quizzes necessary to creating my personal profile I undertook the three tests of the Myer-Briggs 16 personalities test, the leadership style test, and the learning style test.
      </p>

      <p>
        My results of the Myer-Briggs test came out to be INFP, however the while the intuitive, feeling, and prospecting aspects of the test all came out heavily favouring their side of the results, my results for the introverted against the extraverted came extremely close together with 54% introverted. While I feel I agree with the results of the test as a general overview of my personality type are close to being accurate, I believe that on any given day I could end up with an ENFP result. While an INFP may be considered emotional, I think that aspect of the personality can be a benefit when working within a group or team setting. The ability to be in tune with the emotions and feelings of a group can benefit with sharing the burden of stress and anxiety when working on an important project or crunching to reach a deadline. Furthermore, my ‘fence-sitting’ between INFP and ENFP may be beneficial when guiding a group when I am tasked with a leadership role.
      </p>

      <p>
        Continuing from my last point, my second test, the leadership test, came back with me having the result of being a “front-line” leader. One of the primary aspects of a front-line leader is their emotional intelligence within a team and their ability to be in tune with their team members to boost them up and have everyone work towards a common goal. Similar to my results with the Myers-Briggs test, I believe that the test is mostly accurate as a general sense of my leadership style and the way I work when acting as a group leader, however I personally I do not like to take the primary role as a leader, but rather would act as someone the leader can come to when in need of a second opinion or guidance when they feel lost. This is where the emotional intelligence aspects of both the INFP result and the front-line leader result I believe are accurate and are beneficial to me working within a team environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, through the learning style quiz it came out that I was primarily an auditory listener. I think this benefits working and leading teams greatly as it enforces connections and communication with my team members not only if I need to solve a problem that I am having, but to gather ideas in ways that may not be as formal as meetings, but rather visiting someone’s workspace and having them explain the solution to my issue or the idea that they have come up with in the team.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Project Idea
      </h2>

      <p>
        For my project idea I would like to propose and app that allows for younger people to create groups to keep track of their locations when they are going on nights out. Within the app, the users who are going out will be able to ‘check in’ to different bars and clubs that they are attending during their night out, as well as plan where they expect to go in for the night out, and the users who may not be going out will be able to look where the other users in the group plan to go, but also where they end up checking into during their night out.
      </p>

      <p>
        My primary motivation for creating something specifically designed for going out comes from my personal experience of having friends regularly go out on Friday and Saturday nights while I was working and sending them messages such as ‘stay safe’ and telling them to ‘let me know when they get home’. Furthermore, I understand the people aged 18 to 25 tend to be more hesitant to have their parents as involved with their lives and where they are going and thus may be unwilling to install other applications such as life360. By targeting the youth with this app, I believe that they would be more willing to share this information of where they are going with their friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the design of my application, I have two primary user bases in mind; those going out and those who are not. While these two userbases have specific features targeted to them, they are no user is locked from using any feature at any time.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those who are going out the primary functions that they would be prompted to use would be planning their night, checking in at the venues that they go to, and sending alerts to the users within their group and friend list. With planning, a user can set where the plan to be during their night, as well as at what time they expect to get there and leave. These times will be auto adjusted when checking in first when they enter but also when they enter a new venue. Furthermore, by planning other users can know ahead where they can expect to find them during the night. Additionally, the check in feature allows for users to be pseudo tracked by having their location at the venue logged into the system of the app. This will set their location on a map with other users they are either friends or in a group with to see. The final main feature of a user going out is the ability to send alerts to certain friends or groups when a user feels uncomfortable or that they are at risk at any given time. To do this, a user would simply open the app and press a button which would auto send an alert to other selected user within their group of friends or friends list that they can have preselected prior to needing to send the alert. For simplicity, the alert would be selected from a small list of options such as “I’m in danger”, “I’m uncomfortable”, and “I’ve drunk too much”.

      </p>

      <p>
        When creating the app there are various elements that will be required to have the app function as intended, such as the actual application as well as a large database to store both user information and venue information. Furthermore, a map feature will be necessary for my idea of displaying where users are checked into at any given point. For this, I think the easiest way to have a map service would be to use google maps, as the names of streets and venues would already be implemented within the app software. Additionally, a database is extremely important in storing the information which can be made using SQLite, taking advantage of it being open source.

      </p>

      <p>
        While the users going out have a primary set of features to use, users who are not also have a set list of features targeted towards them. The two primary features for a user who is not going out is tracking the location of their friends and sending pings to their friends to check that they are still where the app says or if they have moved. Within the app, a map having the location of all the friends a certain user has in the app will be displayed. For a user who isn’t out, the ability to keep track on where their friends are is vital, that’s why a map displaying the locations of all their friends the names of the venues that they are at is one of the major features of the app. Additionally if a user fears that their friend may be in a situation they can't get out of, they would be able to send a prompt notification through the app to ask the friend for an update on the situation, and thus, if necessary, to alert nearby friends to help or to contact the venue or authorities if needed. This enables the user who is at home to keep peace of mind knowing that they are still able to help a friend who is in trouble promptly without having to rush into the city and wasting time when a rapid response may be necessary.

      </p>

      <p>
        When building the application two of the primary skills that will be needed will be a good knowledge of setting up and maintaining databases, and a proficiency with making mobile applications on both IOS and Android devices. Furthermore, the implementation of the application’s features, such as being able to send alerts to certain individuals, will also be necessary in completing a full and functioning application. I believe that the implementation of these features is extremely doable when a proficiency of programming in whatever language is chosen for the project is had. Overall, the application is an extremely possible design for an application to be made and created.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, if the application was built and a release was made for the public to use, I believe that the app would be extremely successful. I believe the emphasis on creating a safer way to spend time out with friends in a younger age group would result in an influx of users, who will be able to suggest improvements and additional features that would be beneficial within their inclusion to the application. Furthermore, by having an expansive user base, the ability for more and more friends to remain connected this way while being out in the city would further increase the safety of the youth that uses the app. Additionally, having clubs, bars, and other venues integrated with the app could allow for direct intervention if a patron of their venue needed assistance with an issue while on their premises.
