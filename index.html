    <h2> <b> <u>Personal Information</u> </b> </h2>
      <p>Hey! I’m Lachie, a first-year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying a bachelor’s degree in information technology. While I am technically a first year, I had completed the first semester of a Computer Science degree at RMIT in 2021, however due to the move to online classes in second semester and personally not enjoying the course at that point I decided to take the second semester off and start fresh in IT in 2022.  </p>
      <p>I like to think of myself as quite a unique individual, however a fair amount of the hobbies that I have could be considered quite normal. In my free time I am an avid gamer, as well as a fan of both Anime and Manga. As far as gaming goes, I love playing first-person shooters primarily having played Overwatch for the better part of 5 years, before moving to playing Valorant following building a gaming PC in the middle of 2021 (don’t ask my bank account how it’s doing, it still hasn’t recovered). With anime and manga, the primary genre I am a fan is shōnen. My top three anime/manga that I’ve seen or read would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(franchise)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akira</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Stone</a>. I have also recently started reading again and am currently progressing through the works of the Japanese surrealist author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haruki Murakami</a>, with his novel ‘Norwegian Wood’ having quickly become my favourite book. </p>
